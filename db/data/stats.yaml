# IMPORTANT:
# - stats are identified by a universally unique identifier (UUID, version 4)
# - you can use a tool to generate them safely: https://www.uuidgenerator.net
# - they MUST be version 4!
# - this UUID is on the left-hand side of the colon for each question
# - when modifying stats, it's important that you don't change the UUID
# - to add a new stat, you'll need to generate a new UUID
# - you should never replace a stat completely while keeping the UUID the same
# - if you don't know what you're doing, ask!
