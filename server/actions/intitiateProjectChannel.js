*Time to start work on your project!*

The first step is to create an appropriate project artifact.
Once you've created the artifact, connect it to your project with the \`/project set-artifact\` command.

Run \`/project set-artifact --help\` for more guidance.

  await chatClient.sendChannelMessage(channelName, projectWelcomeMessage1)
  await chatClient.sendChannelMessage(channelName, projectWelcomeMessage2)
